# SudokuUnity
Sudoku Prime: a puzzle printed on a square grid of nine large squares each subdivided into nine smaller squares, the object of which is to fill in each of the 81 squares so that each column, row, and large square contains every number from 1 to 9. I developed it using Unity.
The main .apk file of the game is in Build Folder. You can access it.
